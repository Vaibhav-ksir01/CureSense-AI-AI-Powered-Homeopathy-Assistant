# Intellex: AI-Powered Knowledge Assistant

**Intellex** is an AI-powered assistant that transforms unstructured PDFs into structured **Neo4j Knowledge Graphs**, enabling intelligent, contextual question answering. It combines **Autogen Agents**, **LangChain's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and **OpenAI/Azure OpenAI LLMs** for advanced reasoning, querying, and answering with graph-enhanced knowledge.

- 🤖 **Autogen Agent Teams** for keyword extraction, data querying, and response generation  
- 🔍 **LangChain-enhanced RAG** to improve retrieval quality  
- 📂 **PDF folder ingestion**, customizable via a single path  
- 📈 **Graph plotting and interactive visualization**  
- 💬 **Chat interface via `main.py`**  
- 🔐 Credential management with `.env` file

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Vaibhav-ksir01/Intellex-AI-Powered-Knowledge-Assistant.git
cd Intellex-AI-Powered-Knowledge-Assistant
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 🖥️ Setting Up Neo4j

#### ✅ Neo4j Desktop (Local)

- Download Neo4j Desktop from the official site
- Create and start a new project and database
- Copy the Bolt URI, username, and password

#### ☁️ Neo4j AuraDB (Cloud)

- Visit Neo4j AuraDB and create a free database instance
- Note your Bolt URI, username, and password

---

### 🔐 Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```
# Use 'openai' or 'azure'
PROVIDER=openai

# OpenAI Credentials
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Azure OpenAI Credentials (if using azure)
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_openai_key
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=your_deployment_name
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-05-15

# Neo4j Credentials
NEO4J_URI=your_neo4j_uri
NEO4J_USERNAME=your_neo4j_username
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your_neo4j_password
NEO4J_DATABASE=your_database_name
```

---

### 🗂️ Data Preparation

- Store all your PDF files in a folder
- Set the correct folder path inside `data_extraction.py`

You do not need to run `data_extraction.py` manually — it's called within `plot_graph.py`.

---

### 📈 Graph Creation & Visualization

1. **Build the Graph from Documents**

```
python plot_graph.py
```

This processes the PDFs and creates the knowledge graph in Neo4j.

2. **Visualize the Graph**

- Open it in Neo4j Desktop/AuraDB Browser
- Or use:

```
python show_graph.py
```

---

### 💬 Running the Chatbot

Once the graph is created, launch the chatbot:

```
python main.py
```

---

### 🧠 How it works:

- User enters a natural language query
- A team of Autogen Agents extract keywords
- These keywords generate a Neo4j query to fetch relevant data
- A second agent team takes this data + the original query
- The final, context-aware answer is generated by the LLM

This pipeline ensures deep understanding, structured retrieval, and smart responses.

---

## ⚙️ Customization

### 🔧 Modify Agent Logic

To customize the intelligence and workflow:

- Edit `agents.py` to define tools, chains, and behaviors
- Useful for specific domains (legal, academic, medical, etc.)
